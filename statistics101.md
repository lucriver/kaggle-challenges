## Statistics Notes


#### Handling Data Before Training
1. Data Loading and EDA
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Transformation
4. Feature Engineering
5. Feature Selection

#### Confidence Interval
- "Based on the sample data we have, if we were to extend our findings to the entire population, we are X% confident that the true population value would fall within this range."

#### Univariate Analysis
- When you analyze data by looking at one variable at a time.

#### Bivariate Analysis
- When you analyze two variables together.

#### Multivariate analysis
- When you evaluate multiple variables (more than two) to identify any possible association among them.

#### Measuring importance of Nomninal-Categorical vs. Continuous/Ordinal Features
  - Nominal-Categorical
    - Often measured by observing how different categories relate to changes in the target variable.
      - Chi-square test
        - Test if two categorical variables are independent or influencing the test statistic
      - ANOVA
  - Continuous/Ordinal
    - Done by looking at correlation coefficients or use models that can measure feature importance.
      - Linear Regression Coefficients.

#### Outliers
- An outlier is an observation that deviates significantly from the majority of the datapoints in a dataset. Outliers can be caused by various factors like errors and entry mistakes, rare but valid extreme values and anomalies or unusual events.

### Normal Distribution
- Gaussian distribution/bell curve, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean and follows a specific mathematical formula.
- A perfect normal distribution has the mean, meadian and model be equal and located at the center of the distribution.
- A perfect normal distribution is symmetric, with 50% of the data falling on each side of the mean.
- A perfect normal distribution data follows the 68-95-99.7 rule, meaning approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, 95% within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations.


#### Standard Deviation
- A measure of how dispered the data is in relation to the mean.
- A low standard deviation indicates data is clustered around the mean, while high deviation sugguest data points are spread out.
