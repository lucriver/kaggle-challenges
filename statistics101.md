## Statistics Notes

#### Confidence Interval
- "Based on the sample data we have, if we were to extend our findings to the entire population, we are X% confident that the true population value would fall within this range."


#### Univariate Analysis
- When you analyze data by looking at one variable at a time.

#### Bivariate Analysis
- When you analyze two variables together.

#### Multivariate analysis
- When you evaluate multiple variables (more than two) to identify any possible association among them.

#### Measuring importance of Nomninal-Categorical vs. Continuous/Ordinal Features
  - Nominal-Categorical
    - Often measured by observing how different categories relate to changes in the target variable.
      - Chi-square test
        - Test if two categorical variables are independent or influencing the test statistic
      - ANOVA
  - Continuous/Ordinal
    - Done by looking at correlation coefficients or use models that can measure feature importance.
      - Linear Regression Coefficients.
